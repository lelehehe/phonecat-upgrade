## Overview

## Steps
- [x] 1.1 Switching to TypeScript

when running "npm run tsc:w", if you don't have any ts file yet, you would end up TS18003 error. Rename at least one js file to ts before running that command. 
Rename all js files, npm start works fine.

Stopped at upgrade.html page "Now that we have TypeScript though, we can start benefiting from some of its features. There's a lot of value the language can provide to AngularJS applications."
